**Hello, my name is Julien. Welcome to my digital portfolio!**

I'm a recent master's in economics graduate from The University of Utah. I'm also a graduate from The University of Utah's data analytics bootcamp and am eager to apply my passion for socially impactful public policy through a data driven approach. In addition to a background in public service after an 8 year career on active duty in the United States Marine Corps, I've already gained hands on experience in the policy and data analytics space as a graduate research assistant at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. From cleaning and preprocessing data to performing exploratory data analysis and creating insightful visualizations, I'm ready to apply my econometric skillset to real-world scenarios!
